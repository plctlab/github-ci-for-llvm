# v8-riscv CI Tool

This directory defines a server which listens for webhooks from GitHub to
trigger a build and test procedure. It performs the following checks:

- The repository is `plctlab/llvm-project`
- The review state is **approved**
- The reviewer is in the list of approved reviewers

These conditions are in place to ensure that the process only runs on code that
has been reviewed by a trusted developer.

The tool sends status to GitHub using the context `ci`. This can be used to in
the branch protection rules to specify that a PR may not be merged unless this
process has run successfully.

When it sends this status, it includes a link to the output from the command, so
that we may check the errors or see the results.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

This tool is built in Node.js, so you will need to ensure that is installed. You
can install it via your OS's
[package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions-enterprise-linux-fedora-and-snap-packages)
or by [downloading a installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

It also uses docker to build and run the tests, so you will need to have
[docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) as well.

### Setup

First, you must define the following environment variables or create a file,
`.env`, which stores the sensitive data:

```
BASE_URL=<URL-of-this-server>
WEBHOOK_SECRET=<my-secret>
GITHUB_TOKEN=<my-token>
```

The webhook secret must match the value in the GitHub
[webhooks settings](https://github.com/plctlab/llvm-project/settings/hooks). The GitHub
token can be a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) that
has the _repo:status_ permissions for the plctlab/llvm-project repo (to post statuses)
and the _read:org_ permission for the v8-riscv organization (to read
organization members).

Next, make any changes needed to the configuration in `config.json`.

### Run the Server

Start the server using the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Setup the [webhooks](https://github.com/plctlab/llvm-project/settings/hooks) to POST to
this server, at the `/hooks` endpoint. If the server is running on a machine
that does not have a static IP or is not accessible via the Internet, you may
use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose it as a public URL.

Optionally daemonize this server using pm2:

```
pm2 start --name llvm-ci index.js
pm2 log llvm-ci
```

### Setting Up the Webhook on GitHub

In the project's settings, go to the Webhook page
(https://github.com/plctlab/llvm-project/settings/hooks). Click the "Add webhook" button.
For "Payload URL", add the URL of the server, followed by the "/hooks" endpoint,
for example, "https://llvm.ngrok.io/hooks". Ensure that the content type
is set to "application/json". The "Secret" should match what you put in the .env
file (see above). Enable SSL verification is recommended. For the triggers,
select "Let me select individual events.", then check off "Pull requests" and
"Pull request reviews". Finally, ensure "Active" is checked, then click "Update
webhook".
